# Contributing
We love contributions! We've compiled these docs to help you understand our contribution guidelines. If you still have questions, please contact a maintainer, we'd be super happy to help.

Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

Try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch. However, 
if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version, you should open a new issue.


## Pull Request Guidelines

- Branch from `main`.
- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.
- Make sure your `bundle exec rspec` passes.
- If adding a new feature:
  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.
- If fixing bug:
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.
